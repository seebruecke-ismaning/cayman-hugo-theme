## Minimum Hugo version

Hugo version `0.58.3` or higher is required. View the [Hugo releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) and download the binary for your OS.

**Note**: The extended version of Hugo is only required if you wish to edit style-related params in your config file. This is because this theme uses Hugo Pipes and SCSS.
